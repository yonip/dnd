#+TITLE: D&D Ref
* Introduction
Welcome to the campaign! This is where I'll be leaving references for the players to use. 

The player characters start the campaign in or around Neverwinter. Through various means, they are 
contacted and hired by Gundren Rockseeker to escort his cart of supplies south, to the frontiertown
of Phandalin. Gundren, along with a his human companion Sildar Hallwinter, have gone ahead of the party
to attend to business in Phandalin. 

Phandalin itself is a frontier-town, built on the ruins of an old human town, resettled recently by
prospectors who (like Gundren) have heard of treasures in them there hills.
